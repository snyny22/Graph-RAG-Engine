FAISS is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
It supports IndexFlatIP, IVF, HNSW, and more. You can perform approximate nearest neighbour search at scale.
Common use: store sentence embeddings and query with cosine similarity (via inner product on normalized vectors).
